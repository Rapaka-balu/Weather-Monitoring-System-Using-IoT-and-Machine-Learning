Prediction of weather of a particular location based on the previous weather data of the location 



- The Random Forest Regressor model successfully predicts temperature based on timestamp, humidity, and light intensity.
- Descriptive statistics provide insights into feature characteristics.
- The model's performance was evaluated using MSE and R2.
- Model accuracy within a tolerance of Â±1.0 degrees was assessed.

This project demonstrates the process of collecting, preprocessing, exploring, modeling, and evaluating a dataset for temperature prediction. Further improvements may involve hyperparameter tuning or exploring other regression algorithms for enhanced accuracy.
